# SIMPLE VOTEKICK SYSTEM #
### An addon for Garry's Mod ###

No edgy name, no big promises and no complex systems. 

This is just it, a simple votekicking system so players in your server can kick griefers when admins are not online.

Open the menu by saying !votekick, vote yes by saying !yes and no by saying !no.
Whenever you call a vote, you'll have a cooldown. If you get voted off, you'll get banned for some time depending on the configuration.

**A vote will be passed only if _half of the server_ has voted and there are more _Yes_ votes than _No_ votes.**

This addon has two main configurations:
- The amount of minutes a player is banned when voted off.
- The amount of seconds that a player has to wait until they can call another vote.
